**Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)** is used to structure a web page. In this HTML code, which item is the **tag**?:

--- code ---
---
language: html
filename: index.html
line_numbers: false
---   
<img src="star.png" alt="A five-pointed yellow star."> 

--- /code ---

- (x) `<img>`

  --- feedback ---
  
  Correct! In HTML tags appear inside angle brackets. The `<img>` tag is used to add an image with alternative text. 
 
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) `src="star.png"`

  --- feedback ---

Not quite, this is an **attribute**. The attribute being used here is the source attribute. It lets the browser know where the image is stored. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) `alt`

  --- feedback ---

Try again. This is the identifier for the attribute that tells the browser what the **alternative text** (alt) should be.
