In this project you created a numbered top 5 list of emojis. Which HTML tags are used to create an ordered list?


--- choices ---

- ( ) `<ul>` and `<li>`

  --- feedback ---
  
  Very close. The `<ul>` tag is used to create unordered lists where each item starts with a bullet. `<ul>` is used to create lists of items where the order is not important.

- (x) `<ol>` and `<li>`

  --- feedback ---

Correct! `<ol>` means ordered list. `<li>` is used to create list items inside an ordered list. When you use `<ol>`, the items are numbered automatically.

Not quite. `<ul>` and `<ol>` are used to create different kinds of lists in HTML.
