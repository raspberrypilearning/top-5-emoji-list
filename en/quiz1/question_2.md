You used different animation styles with `@keyframes` rules to create transitions. 

How long, in **total** will the animation using the code below run for?

`animation: rotate-center linear 4s 2;`

- ( ) 2 seconds

Take another look. This animation will run twice but it won't run for two seconds in **total**.
 
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 4 seconds

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. If this animation was set to run **once** then it would last four seconds (`4s`). However, this animation runs **twice**.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) 6 seconds

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. The two numbers give the number of seconds that the animation takes and the number of times it should repeat. 

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) 8 seconds

  --- feedback ---

  Correct! The animation takes `4s` to run and it repeats **twice**. Two times four gives eight seconds total.
