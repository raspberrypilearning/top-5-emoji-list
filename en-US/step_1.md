<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">CSS animations</span> are used to grab people's attention and make a website engaging without slowing down the loading of pages. The animations work by changing one or more properties of an element over a period of time. Examples of animations are hover effects, loading images, text animation, particle effects, and animated images.
</p>

You will:
+ Use **lists**, **block quotes**, and **links** in HTML
+ Use CSS **animations** to make your page attract people's attention
+ Create your own **CSS class** that makes elements transparent so you can see a background image

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**content writer**</span> or content author researches and writes interesting articles for a website. Top 5 or 10 lists are popular with lots of people. What would you make a list about?
